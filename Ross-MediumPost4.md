# Lessons from April 16th

[//]: # (Could crop the image; it's a little tall)
This past weekend was an emotional time for the Virginia Tech community. April 16th marked the 10-year anniversary of the shooting which **that** rocked not only the Tech campus, but the entire world. The United States came under fire for its gun culture, and Virginia Tech faced heavy criticism for its handling of the situation. Now, 10 years later, #WeRemember is a frequent refrain with reference to the tragedy that once unfolded in Blacksburg-- **<=Maybe a paragraph break =>** I can’t help wondering, though, if the school remembers enough.

A major factor in the shooting was that its perpetrator, a Tech student, did not receive adequate treatment for his mental health problems. The university was not made aware of his illnesses upon his enrollment, and they also refused to send him to counseling without his consent. Even when he voluntarily attended counseling, he was never institutionalized, which enabled him to later purchase guns.

The university took steps to improve their mental health resources in the aftermath of April 16th, 2007.  Barriers between individual mental health records and university officials were decreased, and Norris Hall was renovated to house a Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention. Virginia Tech was widely praised for the solidarity shown by the student body and community in light of the tragedy. Most students who have been to the school’s main counseling center, Cook Counseling, speak highly of the quality of the care it offers. I attended Cook for a semester, and I was also pleased with the treatment I found there. One frustrating thing, though, was just how little room they had to accommodate all the students who need their services. My counselor struggled to find an open spot in her calendar to make my appointments, and sometimes I would go three weeks between them.

In recent months, the university has spent millions of dollars on unnecessary additions to its campus, like a multimillion indoor football practice facility. Millions of dollars are funneled into athletic programs and advertising every year. That money could instead be offered to Tech’s mental health resources, like Cook.

The well-being of students is far more important than the school’s popular image, and it deserves funding. If more money was allocated to on-campus mental health resources like counseling, students would be better for it.  If April 16th taught this campus anything, it should be that mental health of students should be paid attention to and invested in.
