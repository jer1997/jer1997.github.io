#Paws for Peace

A brief glimpse at Virginia Tech’s bustling campus reveals not only thousands of students walking to and from class, but a surprising number of dogs, too. Many of these pups sport brightly colored vests which designate them as service dogs-in-training, and they trot faithfully alongside the students responsible for training them. The sight of all these students and their canine companions might, in fact, give the impression that obtaining and training a service dog-- or even just a pet-- during one’s time in college is pretty easy. One Tech student, however, wants her peers to know that caring for a dog requires a huge amount of commitment and effort. But if they’re willing to put in the work, the reward is incomparable.

Amanda Hall is a sophomore studying Industrial and Systems Engineering, and she is practically inseparable from her Goldendoodle mix, Bentley-- except for when she has class, of course. Six month-old Bentley has already made tons of friends on campus, as hardly anyone can resist his fluffy coat, floppy paws and huge dark eyes. His role in Hall’s life, however, goes beyond mere cuteness. He serves as her emotional support animal, helping her to cope with serious mental illnesses. I recently had the chance to ask Hall about her experience with Bentley thus far. Read on to find out more!

Why did you get an emotional support animal?
I've been dealing with bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety for almost six years now. This past Thanksgiving, I got an emotional support dog, because my medication and counseling left me unsatisfied. I had a feeling there was a missing piece to my puzzle and started looking for options. I talked about the possibility of getting an emotional support dog with my parents and brought it up with my psychiatrist, the doctor who prescribes my medication. He told me it was going to be a lot of work, and I knew that. But he said if I commit myself, an emotional support animal could help me live a happier life alongside my medication.

What does a typical day look like with him?

Puppies thrive on schedules, commitment, outdoor exercise, and care- all things that also help me each day to deal with my disorders. I take Bentley on three or four walks a day, and I take him on hikes and new adventures often. He helps get me out of bed when I feel incapable of doing anything, and he calms me down when I feel panic attacks coming on. His presence helps me control my mood swings, and his personality never fails to make people smile.

What advice do you have for college students looking to get a pet, especially an emotional support animal?

Bentley has given me a new outlook on life. It's not always easy, but I always remind myself that while he is just a part of my life, I am his whole life. It's up to me to give this pup the best life I possibly can. He reminds me daily that I have purpose, that I am worth it, and that I've got a lot to give. For other college students looking into getting an emotional support animal, know that it is definitely a big commitment. For me, Bentley was a good fit alongside my medication and counseling, but that may not be the case for everyone. Remember that your mental health matters.

Taking care of Bentley is absolutely a lot of work, but I expected that going in. No matter how you choose to work on your mental health, you will have to put in work. Whether it's talking with a counselor, taking a medication, eating healthy, getting active, or investing time in an emotional support animal, your mental health is not something to put on the back burner; invest time and energy, because you are worth it.
